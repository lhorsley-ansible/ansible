# Ansible

### My project to run ansible controller

- aws - instance needs aptitude installed to do updates
- ansible-playbook -i inventory/<hosts-file>  playbooks/<playbook>.yml
- ansible.cfg does not get read from playbooks dir, use root dir to store ansible.cfg
- specify hosts file in ansible.cfg
